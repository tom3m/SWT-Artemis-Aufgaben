== Other
* Visual appearance of the application
 - When an admin creates a new product with image dimensions different to image dimensions of already existing products, the dimensions of the text in the shop of the product is off
 - The layout of the financial overview table overlaps on smaller screens and aren't readable anymore
* Missing Features
 - If the repair order is still in progress and you change the wage of the worker it doesn't recalculate the total price of the repair order
 - The search bar doesn't have any functionality
 - The inventory doesn't automatically restock
 - Big amounts of money could have decimal places (eg. instead of 10015.0€ it could be 10.015,00€)
* Interaction with the application (Usability)
 - The error message "Nicht ausreichend auf Lager" is not readable on a device with darkmode
 - Don't preselect Options for a custom grandfather clock (It may confuse the user and also makes it impossible for the user to tell whether they forgot to select an option)
 - For many transactions it would be hard to differentiate earnings ("Einnahmen") and spendings ("Ausgaben"), a filter button would be useful

== Suggestions for improvement
* German as browser language
 - FAQ: German second question should be "Wie ändere ich mein Passwort?"
 - Catalog (Admin): text input placeholders should also be in German
 - Catalog (Admin): "Image" and "Choose File" should be in German
 - Inventory: "Minimum stock" and "Order Quantity" should be in German
 - Employees: "Assigned orders" should be in German
* English as browser langauge
 - Repairs: in the select for the Clock Type the types should have English names
 - Repair Orders: Delivery option and Materials should be in English if the table is in English
 - Financial overview: Table should be in English when Table head is in English
 - “Einnahme Bestellung”, “Einnahmen”, "Erfüllung des Auftrags ...", "Materialverbrauch ...", "Automatische Nachkaufen von ...", "Verlust" und “Ausgaben” is in German, but other Text such as "Total Income", "Total Expenses" and "Profit" and the table header is in English
* Other
- Change the name for Catalog because the difference between shop and catalog is not obvious and the name is confusing
- Also have the search bar on the homepage
- When creating a custom grandfather clock a picture to see the grandfatherclock would be nice
